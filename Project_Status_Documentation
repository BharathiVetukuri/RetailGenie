# Project Status Documentation

## 1. Azure Account and Resource Setup

- Created an Azure free trial account.
- Set up a new resource group: `retailgenie-rg` in East US region.

## 2. Azure Machine Learning Workspace

- Deployed Azure Machine Learning workspace: `retailgenie-workspace`.
- Linked supporting resources:
  - Storage Account
  - Key Vault
  - Application Insights
  - Log Analytics Workspace

## 3. Supporting Azure Resources

- Created and configured:
  - Storage account: `retailgeniewor...` (auto-generated)
  - Key vault: `retailgeniewor...` (auto-generated)
  - Application Insights: `retailgeniewor...` (auto-generated)
  - Log Analytics workspace: `retailgeniewor...` (auto-generated)

## 4. Azure ML Studio Access

- Accessed Azure ML Studio via the workspace overview.
- Launched the ML Studio web interface for further operations.

## 5. Compute Resource Provisioning

- Navigated to the Compute section in Azure ML Studio.
- Created a compute instance for development and training:
  - Name: `retailgenie-training`
  - VM Size: Standard_DS3_v2 (CPU)
  - Auto-shutdown enabled for cost control

## 6. (Optional) Compute Cluster

- Provided instructions for creating a compute cluster for scalable training/inference (not mandatory for initial setup).

## 7. Project Readiness

- All core Azure ML infrastructure is now ready for:
  - Running notebooks and scripts
  - Training and registering models
  - Setting up CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, Databricks)
  - Model deployment and monitoring

---

**Next Steps:**

- Connect local codebase to Azure ML workspace
- Run test notebooks/scripts on the compute instance
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated training, testing, and deployment
- Train and register first ML model
- Deploy model for inference
- Set up monitoring and alerts
