ðŸ“‘ Project Deliverables
End-to-end ML or ML Ops pipeline with:
 The core defining the model - code should be substantial  (if the model definition is just 10 - 50
 lines  - something wrong - 50% of score is based on how complex the problem you are solving
 and how complex your model or combination of models are) and is the meat of the project. Your
 model architecture, training loop, etc.,



 Do not try to risk having  projects requiring large number of gpus/tpus - show case it on very
 small data set. extra points if you train your project on tpu.
